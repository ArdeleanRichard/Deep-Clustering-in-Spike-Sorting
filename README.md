## Overview

This project provides a large-scale **benchmark of 12 deep clustering algorithms** against the traditional spike sorting pipeline (feature extraction combined with K-means clustering).

**Traditional spike sorting** separates representation learning and clustering into distinct steps, which may not optimally capture the complex structure of spike data. **Deep clustering** addresses this by performing a dual optimization, effectively learning non-linear representations tailored for clustering. Our findings indicate that these deep clustering approaches are the most suitable methods for accurately identifying individual neuronal activity in modern multi-electrode recordings.

## Datasets

### Synthetic Spike Waveforms (Pedreira et al., 2012)
- **Description**: 95 single-channel synthetic datasets (simulations) were analyzed. These were created based on "in vivo" recordings from a monkey brain.
- **Parameters**: Performance was analyzed across datasets with varying **cluster counts (2-20)** and complexity.
- **Cluster Composition**: Each dataset contains a single **multi-unit cluster** and the rest are single-unit clusters.

## Methods Benchmarked

The study compares deep clustering against the traditional two-stage pipeline.

### Deep Clustering Algorithms
A total of **12 deep clustering algorithms** were benchmarked.
- **Key Algorithms**: **ACeDeC, AEC, DCN, DDC, DEC, DeepECT, DipDECK, DipEncoder, DKM, IDEC, VaDE, N2D**.

### Traditional Pipeline
- **Feature Extraction**: Linear (**PCA, ICA**) and Non-linear/Manifold (**Isomap, LLE, t-SNE, Diffusion Map**) methods.
- **Clustering**: Clustering was performed using **K-Means** for evaluation of the feature extraction methods.

## Results Summary

Performance was evaluated using six clustering metrics: **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), Purity, Silhouette Score (SS), Calinski-Harabasz Score (CHS), and Davies-Bouldin Score (DBS)**.

**Key findings:**
- **Superior Performance**: A subset of deep clustering algorithmsâ€”particularly **ACeDeC, DDC, DEC, IDEC, and VaDE**â€”significantly outperformed traditional methods, especially as dataset complexity increased.
- **Top Performers**:
    - **DDC** excelled on datasets with low to medium cluster counts.
    - **DEC, IDEC, and VaDE** were the top performers for datasets with a medium to high number of clusters.
- **Multi-Unit Cluster**: The top-performing deep clustering methods were capable of correctly identifying the multi-unit cluster in the synthetic data.
